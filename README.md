# ✈️ Customer Flight Booking Prediction (British Airways)
# 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict whether a customer will complete a flight booking based on their booking behavior, trip details, and optional service selections. The project was completed as part of the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program, focusing on applying machine learning to real-world airline business problems.

The solution combines data preprocessing, supervised machine learning, and model deployment through an interactive web application.
